### JavaScript Principles
JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means it can only execute one task at a time. It's engine processes code sequentially, executing one statement at a time in the order they appear in the code. This single-threaded execution model is one of the main reasons JavaScript relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques like callbacks, promises, and async/await.

The thread of execution in JavaScript can be broken down into several components:
- Call Stack
- Execution Context
- Event Loop
- Message Queue

In details:
- **Call Stack:** The call stack keeps track of all the functions that are currently being executed, in what is known as a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order. When the execution of script begins, the JavaScript engine initially creates a global execution context and adds a `global() function` to the top of the stack. Every time a function is `invoked`, it is added to the top of the stack. Every time a function `evaluates` and completes it's execution, it is removed from the stack. The call stack keeps track of the execution context, allowing the JavaScript engine to know which function to execute currently (whichever function is top of the call stack) and where to return after the execution.
- **Execution Context:** an abstract concept representing the environment in which the currently executing code is running. There are three types of execution contexts: global, function, and eval. These contexts hold information about variables, functions, and the value of `this` keyword. They are managed by the JavaScript engine using a call stack.
- **Event Loop:** The event loop is responsible for handling asynchronous callbacks. It continuously checks the message queue for any pending callbacks that need to be executed. If the call stack is empty and there is a callback in the message queue, the event loop pushes the callback onto the call stack and starts executing it. The event loop ensures that JavaScript remains responsive even when executing long-running tasks by allowing the engine to execute other tasks (such as handling user input or running timers) while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete.
- **Message Queue:** The message queue is a data structure that stores callbacks waiting to be executed. Callbacks from asynchronous functions like setTimeout, XMLHttpRequest, or user events (click, keypress, etc.) are placed in the message queue. The event loop processes these callbacks in the order they were added to the queue (First-In-First-Out).

In summary, JavaScript has a single-threaded execution model, with a call stack to manage the execution context, an event loop to handle asynchronous callbacks, and a message queue to store pending callbacks. This model allows JavaScript to handle complex tasks efficiently while maintaining responsiveness.

#### Example
A basic program

```js
const celsiusTemperatureInBulgaria = 31;
const celsiusTemperatureInUSA = 25;

function celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius) {
  const fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32;
  return fahrenheit;
}

const fahrenheitTemperatureInBulgaria = celsiusToFahrenheit(celsiusTemperatureInBulgaria);
const fahrenheitTemperatureInUSA = celsiusToFahrenheit(celsiusTemperatureInUSA);

console.log(`The temperature in Bulgaria of ${celsiusTemperatureInBulgaria}째C is equal to ${fahrenheitTemperatureInBulgaria}째F.`);
console.log(`The temperature in USA of ${celsiusTemperatureInUSA}째C is equal to ${fahrenheitTemperatureInUSA}째F.`);
```

**Basic Explanation**
When JavaScript code runs, it:
- Goes through the code line-by-line and runs (executes) each line, known as the `thread of execution`
- Saves "data" like strings and arrays, to be used later, in it's `memory`. (We can even save a function's code)

**Basic Breakdown**
- Step 1: The engine creates a `global execution context` for the top-level script, which is our example `a basic program`.
- Step 2: In the first line of code, we declared a `const` variable with identifier `celsiusTemperatureInBulgaria` and assigned it the value `31`, so the engine initializes the variable in memory.
    - the memory looks like this:
    ```
    {
        celsiusTemperatureInBulgaria: 31
    }
    ```

- Step 3: In the second line of code, we declared another `const` variable with identifier `celsiusTemperatureInUSA` and assigned it the value `25`, so the engine initializes the variable in memory.
    - the memory looks like this
    ```
    {
        celsiusTemperatureInBulgaria: 31
        celsiusTemperatureInUSA: 25
    }
    ```

- Step 4: In the third line of code, we declared a function with identifier `celsiusToFahrenheit` and assigned it value, technically called `function body`.
    - the memory looks like this
    ```
    {
        celsiusTemperatureInBulgaria: 31,
        celsiusTemperatureInUSA: 25,
        celsiusToFahrenheit: function celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius) {
            const fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32;
            return fahrenheit;
        }
    }
    ```

- Step 5: In the next statement, we declared a `const` variable with identifier `fahrenheitTemperatureInBulgaria` and the engine doesn't know yet what to store in memory, because we assigned a `function call`, which must first be processed.
- Step 6: The engine `invokes` the function with identifier `fahrenheitTemperatureInBulgaria`, which creates a local `function execution context` and passes the parameter `celsius`, with the value `31`, which is technically called an argument. Next the `thread of execution` processes the code and returns in the `global execution context`, where the function `evaluates` to the value `87.8`
